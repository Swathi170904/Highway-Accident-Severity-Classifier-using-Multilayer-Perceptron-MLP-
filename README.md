# Highway-Accident-Severity-Classifier-using-Multilayer-Perceptron-MLP-
This project focuses on predicting the severity of highway accidents using Machine Learning with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. It leverages accident-related data such as weather conditions, road surface, and traffic attributes to classify the severity level of accidents.
